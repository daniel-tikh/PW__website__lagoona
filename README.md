PRACTICAL WORK: LANDING PAGE OF A HOTEL CHAIN

This website was created as part of the online course "Frontend Developer PRO", which I took on the basis of the online professional education platform Skillbox to improve my skills and structure my knowledge.

It was a practical work of the module "Advanced CSS". Problem statement: to fix in practice the work with CSS-pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements and transformations and to build a site on a ready-made graphic template (<a href="//www.figma.com/file/tjkkfkHDXlGscyVbS3emln/Lagoona?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=Wh5OKSHYO0ClVKzj-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">figma layout</a> + UI/UX elements), applying the theoretical material of the training module in practice.
